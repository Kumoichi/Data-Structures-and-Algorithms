# Data Structures and Algorithms

This project aims to implement various data structures and algorithms using Java programming language. The code is developed using IntelliJ IDEA.

## Data Structures Implemented

- Sorting Algorithms: This section contains various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- Queue: The implementation of Queue data structure using linked list is provided. The code includes enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty operations.
- Stack: The Stack data structure is implemented with support for push, pop, and isEmpty operations.
- LinkedListQueue: A queue implementation using a linked list is provided. It includes enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty operations.
- ArrayListQueue: The queue data structure is implemented using an ArrayList. It includes enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty operations.
- Heap: The code includes the implementation of a binary heap data structure. It supports basic operations like insert, delete, and heapify.
- Hash: This section includes the implementation of a hash table using arrays. It supports operations like insert, search, and delete.
- Decision Tree: The implementation of a decision tree is provided. It includes tree construction, tree traversal, and decision-making based on the tree structure.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the source code files.
3. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
4. Locate the file named `Driver.java` in the project directory. This file contains the main method to run the code examples or test cases.
5. Right-click on the `Driver.java` file and select "Run" from the context menu.
6. The code will be executed, and you can observe the output in the IntelliJ IDEA console.
